******************

The project below is a Blackjack game application development.


  We can: 
    - Start a game with 2 randomly selected cards
    - Add new cards at random
    - Lose when we are over 21 points
    - Win when we are at 21 points
    - Continue when we are below 21 points

******************


You can see the Chrome extension that I made at the top right of this image.


  Here we can :
    - Recover the url of the page where we are in an input with a button "SAVE TAB".
    - Save them locally with a "SAVE INPUT" button
    - And if we want, delete everything with a "DELETE ALL" button
